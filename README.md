## "Behind The Scenes" Podcast

### Project Description
- What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create

### Process 
- How did you go about implementing the concept

  #### Izah:
   After a collaborative brainstorming session within our team, I teamed up with Buka to bring our web project to life. Buka took the lead in crafting the website's structure using HTML and CSS, meticulously translating our collective wireframes into a functional design. Meanwhile, I focused on enhancing the website's aesthetic appeal by incorporating various elements.

  I tried using Google Fonts to select typefaces that complemented our design, and fine-tuned the color palette to create a harmonious visual experience. Subtle touches like applying box shadows to sections and hover effects also elevated the overall look of the site. The final touch was integrating audio into the site, a straightforward process that, with a touch of CSS styling, brought the entire project together.


  #### Buka:
  For this project, my role was to work on the overall implementation of the website. As a team, we discussed the general wireframe and user interface design for the webpage. Once we had a general wireframe using Figma, Izah and I initiated the implementation process.

  Initially, I created simple CSS and HTML for the webpage. After Izah worked on the fonts, color palettes, and images for the webpage, I focused on creating a straightforward parallax effect for both the background image and the contents. Given the project's emphasis on a podcast and our limited content, building this webpage presented a bit of a challenge for me. Consequently, I decided to experiment with different effects instead of incorporating many different sections throughout the webpage. I designed the navigation bar to enhance user navigation through different parts of the webpage. Also, I believe including a hover effect on the navigation bar improved the user experience. However, due to the limited content, aside from our podcast snippet, I differentiated each section by applying various effects while using the navigation bar.

  For instance, the home button directs the user to the initial interface when visiting the website. The about button doesn't lead to a different section but rather displays a paragraph about the host and the podcast on the home page. The next section is titled "Episodes," featuring our sound project. Furthermore, I chose the contact button to take the user to the footer section, which includes the contact information, instead of introducing another section.

  I am quite proud of how the footer section turned out. Initially, I included a subscribe button where the user could leave their email to subscribe to the podcast. However, I decided to delete it because it was simpler to just include the contact information there, considering other sections of the webpage were much simpler in terms of interaction and content.

  #### Pierre:
  In this project, once we collaboratively developed the script and outlined the overall framework of the podcast, the next phase involved recording. I took the role of the podcast host "Colin". Following the completion and finalization of the audio by the team, I proceeded to craft a visual design that seamlessly complements and integrates with the audio content that is placed on the website to present the podcast snippet.


 

### Reflection and Evaluation
- This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version
