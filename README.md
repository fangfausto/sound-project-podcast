## "Behind The Scenes" Podcast

### Project Description
- What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create

  After several brainstorming sessions, we decided to go with the concept of creating a podcast. Since the assignment required the audio to be 2-3 mins long, we knew we could not record an entire episode in that short duration so we decided to record a little snippet instead.
  
  The core concept underpinning our audio piece centers on "Behind the Scenes," a podcast hosted by the charismatic Collins. This podcast falls within the entertainment genre and features Collins as he invites prominent figures from the entertainment industry to provide listeners with a rare glimpse into the world "behind the scenes." The main idea was to unravel the various experiences that never quite make it to the screen, offering a backstage pass to the industry's captivating narratives.
  
  Our primary goal was to craft a narrative that could blend engagement with humor, ensuring that the listener remains enthralled throughout. To achieve this, we decided to incorporate a a variety of sound effects in order to transform the auditory experience into a sort of mental imagery. These effects were thoughtfully chosen to compliment the story being narrated, allowing the listeners to paint vivid mental pictures, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.

### Process 
- How did you go about implementing the concept

  #### Fausto:
   For our project, my role was to organize and execute the audio recording, editing, and mixing. In this role, I mainly used the Voice-Meeter audio software to be able to record and manage the audio levels for each of our 2 microphones, and Audacity open-source software to edit/mix the audio tracks together, add the sound effects needed, and apply the filter to our voices when necessary. In the context of the podcast, in addition to helping in the script-writing, I took the role of Ethan Bart, a Hollywood actor who is telling an anecdote that happened filming his upcoming movie.

  Knowing that our project would be a podcast-style experience, before entering the recording stage, I experimented with recording 2 voices straight from the computer microphone. As this turned out to produce a really low-quality sound, I followed up my research by trying to record with 2 phones. However, the biggest problem we faced was the fact that the microphones, because of how they function and their purpose, would take sound from all directions, effectively making an echo effect in our conversation. Finally, I decided to borrow two BLUE Snowball USB microphones from the Interactive Media Lab. The reason why we hesitated to use this approach at first was because the microphones required a special USB-B cable that we didn't have, let alone 2 of them. Thankfully, we were able to finally find these cables and proceeded with the recording. This allowed us to generate an environment where both of us could talk, but the microphones would still take only one voice each, which gives the "podcast" feeling we were looking for.

  To utilize both microphones properly, I initially thought that plugging both of them in would work normally. However, that was clearly not the case, as it only allowed one input at the time. To solve this, I utilized the Voice Meeter Audio Software, which is a comprehensive software that allowed me not only to select the sources of each audio input clearly and mesh them into one output, but also allowed me to test the microphones in an easy and intuitive manner, just producing an echo effect that demonstrated how the audio was being captured. In addition to this, I was able to remove the background noise, modify the volume of each input, and properly mute each mic in the needed moments.

  To add the sound effects, we downloaded free-use sounds from the website [freesound.org](www.freesound.org). After that, I imported them to the Audacity project and applied fade-in, and fade-out effects, corrected the duration of every track, and changed the pitch for some of the sounds in order to adapt them to the sound level. For the telephone voice effect in particular, I found that the equalizer function in Audacity also provided a list of preset effects, one of them being the telephone voice filter.

  In general, I am quite satisfied with the final track we produced. I consider that the skills I learned from producing this audio project would be especially useful in a radio, TV show, or any entertainment production field, as it allowed me to have a small glimpse of how complicated audio management is. Experimenting with Audacity, Voice-Meeter, and good quality microphones was an amazing experience, and if I could improve something in our production, it would be spending more time recording the tracks, as there are small details that we could have been more careful with in terms of audio quality and usage of the Snowball Microphones.
  
  #### Izah:
   After a collaborative brainstorming session within our team, I teamed up with Buka to bring our web project to life. Buka took the lead in crafting the website's structure using HTML and CSS, meticulously translating our collective wireframes into a functional design. Meanwhile, I focused on enhancing the website's aesthetic appeal by incorporating various elements.

  I tried using Google Fonts to select typefaces that complemented our design, and fine-tuned the color palette to create a harmonious visual experience. Subtle touches like applying box shadows to sections and hover effects also elevated the overall look of the site. The final touch was integrating audio into the site, a straightforward process that, with a touch of CSS styling, brought the entire project together.


  #### Buka:
  For this project, my role was to work on the overall implementation of the website. As a team, we discussed the general wireframe and user interface design for the webpage. Once we had a general wireframe using Figma, Izah and I initiated the implementation process.

  Initially, I created simple CSS and HTML for the webpage. After Izah worked on the fonts, color palettes, and images for the webpage, I focused on creating a straightforward parallax effect for both the background image and the contents. Given the project's emphasis on a podcast and our limited content, building this webpage presented a bit of a challenge for me. Consequently, I decided to experiment with different effects instead of incorporating many different sections throughout the webpage. I designed the navigation bar to enhance user navigation through different parts of the webpage. Also, I believe including a hover effect on the navigation bar improved the user experience. However, due to the limited content, aside from our podcast snippet, I differentiated each section by applying various effects while using the navigation bar.

  For instance, the home button directs the user to the initial interface when visiting the website. The about button doesn't lead to a different section but rather displays a paragraph about the host and the podcast on the home page. The next section is titled "Episodes," featuring our sound project. Furthermore, I chose the contact button to take the user to the footer section, which includes the contact information, instead of introducing another section.

  I am quite proud of how the footer section turned out. Initially, I included a subscribe button where the user could leave their email to subscribe to the podcast. However, I decided to delete it because it was simpler to just include the contact information there, considering other sections of the webpage were much simpler in terms of interaction and content.

  #### Pierre:
  In this project, once we collaboratively developed the script and outlined the overall framework of the podcast, the next phase involved recording. I took the role of the podcast host "Colin". Following the completion and finalization of the audio by the team, I proceeded to craft a visual design that seamlessly complements and integrates with the audio content that is placed on the website to present the podcast snippet.


 

### Reflection and Evaluation
Overall, we are all pretty content with the final product. From the audio composition to the web implementation, we believe that we were able to effectively put together different components of the project to create a coherent and engaging experience. 

The time constraint however limited our storytelling potential. Given the freedom of an extended duration, we could have delved deeper into the realm of descriptive narration, enhancing the overall immersive experience. 

One notable achievement that we take pride in is our ability to fashion the final product into an authentic podcast snippet. After listening to different interviews, we were able discern and incorporate the nuanced elements essential for replicating the authenticity of a genuine podcast experience into our audio.
